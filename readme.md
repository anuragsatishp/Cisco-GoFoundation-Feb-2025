## Why Go?
- Simplicity
    - ONLY 25 keywords
    - No access modifiers
    - No reference types (everything is a value)
    - No pointer arithmatic
    - No classes (Only structs)
    - No inheritance (Only composition)
    - No exceptions (Only errors & errors are just values)
    - No try..catch..finally
    - No implicit type conversion
- Performance
    - Equivalent to C++
    - Compiled to machine code
    - Tooling system supports cross-compilation
- Concurrrency
    - Managed concurrency model (built in scheduler)
    - Concurrent operations are represented as "goroutines"
    - Goroutines are cheap (4KB)
    - Support for concurrency is offered in the "language"
        - "go" keyword
        - "chan" data type
        - "<-" operator (channel)
        - "range" construct
        - "select-case" construct
